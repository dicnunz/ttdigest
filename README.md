# TTDigest

TTDigest is an AI-powered digest summarizer for tech Twitter threads. It monitors top AI and tech influencers on X, fetches their most interesting tweets and long threads, and generates concise summaries using GPT models. The goal is to deliver a daily or weekly digest of the most important discussions in the AI/tech community.

## Features

- Tracks curated list of influential AI/tech accounts.
- Fetches trending tweets and long threads.
- Uses a large language model (LLM) to generate concise summaries.
- Exposes a simple dashboard and email digest for easy consumption.
- Fully open-source microâ€¯SaaS built by a solo founder.
